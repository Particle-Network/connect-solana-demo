    Particle Connect Solana Demo
  </h3>
</div>

This example demonstrates integrating social and Web3 logins on the Solana blockchain using [Particle Connect](https://developers.particle.network/api-reference/connect/desktop/web)  and sending a transaction. 

Built using:

- **Particle Connect 2.0**
- **solana/web3.js**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**

## üîë Particle Connect

**Particle Connect** enables a unified modal driving connection with social logins (through Particle Auth) and standard Web3 wallets, creating an equally accessible experience for Web3 natives and traditional consumers. Particle Connect is an all-in-one SDK capable of handling end-to-end onboarding and wallet connection.
